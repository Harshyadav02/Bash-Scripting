#Shell variables are created once they are assigned a value. A variable can contain a number, a character or a string of characters. Variable name is case sensitive and can consist of a combination of letters and the underscore "_". Value assignment is done using the "=" sign. Note that no space permitted on either side of = sign when initializing variables.

# Note :- use $ before the variable while printing the variable 

x=5;
MyFirstLetters=ABC;
greeting='Hello        world!';
echo $x, $MyFirstLetters, $greeting;


y=10;
echo "The value of y is :  $y";
